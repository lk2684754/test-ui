                Filecoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer storage network,
                allowing anyone to store and validate large-scale data as part
                of a global, 15-exabyte (and growing) network. Under the hood,
                all Filecoin nodes use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a
                content-addressed protocol for storing and sharing data.

            NEAR aims to connect users of the Internet today to the
            blockchain-based networks of the future. NEAR is a PoS layer 1
            blockchain platform built with UX and DevX in mind. NEAR's novel
            sharding mechanism, Nightshade, parallelizes on-chain computation
            and automatically increases capacity when needed, enabling
            theoretically infinite scalability; Filecoin is a decentralized
            peer-to-peer data network through which anyone can store or verify
            data. All Filecoin nodes use the IPFS protocol - one of the most
            widely used distributed protocols designed for Web3 We explore from
            the intersection of Filecoin and NEAR. As the entire ecosystem
            develops in a diversified direction, in the near future, there may
            be more data interactions between different systems, eventually
            serving more and more users. Keep human data alive.
